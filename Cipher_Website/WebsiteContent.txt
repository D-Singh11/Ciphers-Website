ROT13 :

Substitution Encryption method: Substitution encryption method is used to replace individual plaintext letters with substitute
encrypted letters, so that the actual meankng of the original plaintext can be hidden.

ROT13 is a type of CASESER CIPHER also known as ShiftCipher  which was used in Rome for encryption. ROT13 cipher uses text replacement
alogoritham in which each alphabet is replaced with the letter situated 13 positions ahead of it in english alphabets table.

ROT13 is not a very secure way of generating secret messages because each encrypted text can be decrypted using the same algorithm.
It can be easily breakable using brute force attack. Therefore this type of cipher is not used for highly sensitive data encryption
It is mainly used in news forums, online blogs etc. Rot13 cipher is widley used to design fun games for kids to teach them problem solving 
at early age.
